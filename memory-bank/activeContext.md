# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Implementing OpenAI model selection in the UI.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Added a new endpoint in the backend to call the OpenAI models API and return the list of models.
*   Modified the frontend to call the new backend endpoint and populate a dropdown with the model names.
*   Implemented the logic to use the selected model when making API calls.

**Next Steps:**

*   Test the OpenAI model selection functionality.
*   Update the remaining memory bank files.
*   Use attempt_completion to present the result.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   How to handle errors when fetching the list of OpenAI models.
*   How to persist the selected model across sessions.

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**

*   Use a modular design for both the backend and frontend.
*   Follow Go coding conventions for the backend.
*   Use React or a similar framework for the frontend.

**Learnings and Project Insights:**

*   The project requires a clear separation of concerns between the backend and frontend.
*   MCP server extensions should be easily pluggable into the system.
