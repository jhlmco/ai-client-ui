# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Setting up the basic project structure and initial files.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Created project directory and memory-bank directory.
*   Created `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`.

**Next Steps:**

*   Create the remaining core memory bank files.
*   Create the Go backend files.
*   Create the Electron frontend files.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   How to best structure the Go backend for handling MCP server extensions.
*   How to design the Electron frontend for a modular and extensible UI.

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**

*   Use a modular design for both the backend and frontend.
*   Follow Go coding conventions for the backend.
*   Use React or a similar framework for the frontend.

**Learnings and Project Insights:**

*   The project requires a clear separation of concerns between the backend and frontend.
*   MCP server extensions should be easily pluggable into the system.
