# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Splitting structs and models from `backend/server/server.go` into a separate file.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Added a new endpoint in the backend to call the OpenAI models API and return the list of models.
*   Modified the frontend to call the new backend endpoint and populate a dropdown with the model names.
*   Implemented the logic to use the selected model when making API calls.
*   Analyzed backend and frontend code and determined that existing implementations should respect `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` environment variables.
*   Modified backend code (`backend/server/server.go`) to explicitly configure HTTP clients to use proxy settings from environment variables, including logic to respect `no_proxy`.
*   Modified frontend code (`frontend/main.js`) to explicitly configure the Electron session to use proxy settings from environment variables.
*   Created `backend/models/models.go` and moved struct definitions from `backend/server/server.go`.
*   Updated `backend/server/server.go` to use the structs from the `models` package.
*   Ran `go mod tidy` in the `backend` directory to update dependencies.

**Next Steps:**

*   Update remaining memory bank files.
*   Use attempt_completion to present the result.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   How to handle errors when fetching the list of OpenAI models.
*   How to persist the selected model across sessions.

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**

*   Use a modular design for both the backend and frontend.
*   Follow Go coding conventions for the backend.
*   Use React or a similar framework for the frontend.

**Learnings and Project Insights:**

*   The project requires a clear separation of concerns between the backend and frontend.
*   MCP server extensions should be easily pluggable into the system.

**Current Status:**

*   Project setup is in progress.
*   Electron frontend is partially functional.
*   Go backend is running.
*   OpenAI model selection is implemented.
*   Explicit proxy configuration with `no_proxy` handling is complete.
*   Structs and models have been successfully moved to a separate file.
