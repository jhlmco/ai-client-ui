# Progress

**What Works:**

*   Basic project structure and memory bank files created.
*   Electron frontend files created and the application can be launched (with non-fatal DBus errors).
*   Go backend implementation and environment configuration.
*   OpenAI model selection functionality.

**What's Left to Build:**

*   MCP server extension loading and management.
*   AI model integration.

**Current Status:**

*   Project setup is in progress.
*   Electron frontend is partially functional.
*   Go backend is running.
*   OpenAI model selection is implemented.

**Known Issues:**

*   DBus errors when running the Electron frontend.
*   `attempt_completion` tool is currently failing.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**

*   Decided to focus on the Electron frontend first due to issues with the Go backend setup.
*   Attempted various Go environment troubleshooting steps without success.
